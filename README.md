Neighborhood Map Project
========================

 Udacity Front End Nanodegree
 ----------------------------

 Project to grab and display interesting information around a neighborhood, using the knockout.js framework.

 To see the site in action, visit [gh-pages](https://askkaz.github.io/neighborhoodMap/).  Your location is represented by the green arrow on the map.  As you click around the map, it moves your marker and updates the Uber prices between your location and the points of interest around DC.

 Clicking on one of the places (on the map or the list) will reveal additional detail about the place in the wiki area below the map.

 Entering text in the search box in the map will reduce the list of places (and markers on the map) to only those that match your query.

 Enjoy!
